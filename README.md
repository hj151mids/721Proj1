# 721Proj1
In this project, I created a microservice that realizes continous integration and delivery.
The main tasks of the project are: 
- Create a Microservice in Flask or Fast API (I used FastAPI)
- Push source code to Github (linked in Cloud9)
- Configure Build System to Deploy changes (makefile, github actions, etc)
- Use IaC (Infrastructure as Code) to deploy code (I used apprunner)
- Use AWS
